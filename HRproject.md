## Why 'R' Our Employees Leaving? - A Data Analysis with 'R'

**Project description:** 

For this project, I was analyzing data from a human resources dataset. There had been a recent increase in the number of people leaving the company, and I was tasked to find out why. 

### The Data

The original dataset came from IBM's human resources division, and can be found at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset). 

I used R as my tool for analysis because this project was focused on statistical analysis, and that is what R is best at. I could have also used Python or Excel, but the dataset is too large for Excel to do well, and Python, while a great language, is not as good as R for statistics.

```python
print('this is the python code I used to solve this problem')
```
