## Massachusetts's State of Education

**Project description:** In this introduction to Tableau data visualization, I was tasked with analyzing MCAS test scores in Massachusetts for the Secretary of Education. I will be looking at how class sizes affect college admissions, the top math schools in the state, and which schools are struggling the most.

### What I Learned

As a teacher in Massachusetts, this data speaks to me. The dataset analyzed was from 2017, and it showed that at the time, there was not a large effect of class size compared to college admissions.


### The Analysis

I'll start with the dashboard, which summarizes my findings.

As you can see, a total of 953,748 students were included in the data, spread across 1,861 schools in the state. This data only includes students and schools who reported to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, the state's office of education oversight. 

**Top Math Schools**

The top math scores were determined by analyzing results of the 4th grade math MCAS.
