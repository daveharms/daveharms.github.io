## Massachusetts's State of Education

**Project description:** In this introduction to Tableau data visualization, I was tasked with analyzing MCAS test scores in Massachusetts for the Secretary of Education. I will be looking at how class sizes affect college admissions, the top math schools in the state, and which schools are struggling the most.

### What I Learned

As a teacher in Massachusetts, this data speaks to me. The dataset analyzed was from 2017, and it showed that at the time, there was not a large effect of class size compared to college admissions.


### The Analysis

I'll start with the dashboard, which summarizes my findings.

As you can see, a total of 953,748 students were included in the data, spread across 1,861 schools in the state. This data only includes students and schools who reported to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, the state's office of education oversight. 

**Top Math Schools**

The top math scores were determined by analyzing results of the 4th grade math MCAS.

These scores reflect only the student test scores for 2017. I will have to do some further analysis to determine if there is a correlation between 4th grade math scores and graduation rates / college acceptance rates.

**Lowest Graduation Rates**

This chart shows the schools in the state with the lowest percentage of students who graduate high school.

Similarly to the math scores, the Secretary of Education did not have us analyze whether the graduation rate has any significance on the number of students who are accepted to college from those schools. However, this chart **does** show that these school are struggling to get students to graduation. This will hopefully lead to discussions on what is causing these low graduation rates and how to fix those issues.

**Class Size vs. College Acceptance**

The final chart shows the possible link between class size and the number of students who are accepted to college.

This scatter plot was further categorized by income, with low income schools in dark blue, and high income schools in dark red. As you can see, there is a fairly even distribution of low, medium, and high income schools with class sizes between 12 and 20, with that same group having between 50 and 95% of students being accepted to colleges. This analysis doesn't show a correlation between class size and college acceptance as far as I can see. I will have to do further analysis to make a clear determination.


### Takeaways

So far, my analysis has not come up with any actionable insights. I have shown the top 4th grade math schools, the schools with the lowest graduation rates, and how class size may affect college acceptance, but there is much more analysis to be done.
