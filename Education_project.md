## Massachusetts's State of Education

**Project description:** In this introduction to Tableau data visualization, I was tasked with analyzing MCAS test scores in Massachusetts for the Secretary of Education. I will be looking at how class sizes affect college admissions, the top math schools in the state, and which schools are struggling the most.

### What I Learned

As a teacher in Massachusetts, this data speaks to me. The dataset analyzed was from 2017, and it showed that at the time, there was not a large effect of class size compared to college admissions.


### The Analysis

I'll start with the dashboard, which summarizes my findings.
