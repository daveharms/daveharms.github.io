## Massachusetts's State of Education

**Project description:** In this introduction to Tableau data visualization, I was tasked with analyzing MCAS test scores in Massachusetts for the Secretary of Education. I will be looking at how class sizes affect college admissions, the top math schools in the state, and which schools are struggling the most.
